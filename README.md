### Background:
Major League Baseball is the only league of the four major sports not to employ a hard salary cap. The lack of spending restrictions results in a 
culture of "haves" and "have nots." Teams in larger media markets, like New York and Los Angeles, have almost unlimited resources to devote to signing and 
acquiring baseball's best, and most expensive talents.

In 1998, the Oakland Athletics, a classic "have not" franchise, hired a little-known, former utility player named Billy Beane as general manager. 
Under some of the tightest spending constraints, Oakland was struggling to compete with the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox and other "haves." Beane and 
his lieutenants eschewed longheld baseball wisdom that emphasized players who hit for high average, knocked in a lot of runs (RBI) and stole a lot of bases. 
Players who compiled these types of stats, commanded large salaries. 

Instead Oakland utilized an emerging set of analytics called sabermetrics which placed importance on stats like on base percentage and slugging percentage. 
As these stats weren't traditionally regarded as important, players who excelled in these areas generally commanded lower salaries.

As a result of this revolutionary approach, which became known as "Moneyball, Oakland has consistently competed with teams that spend as much as six times
more money on players salaries. This phenomenon was the subject of the 2003 book *"Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game,"* by Michael Lewis; as well as 
a 2011 feature film starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill.

This project provides a cursory glance at "Moneyball" and whether Beane and the Athletics organization were successful in getting "bang for their buck."

### Analysis:

#### Wins
Over the 20-year period we examined, the Athletics won 1,729 regular season games – an average of 86.5 per season. The average MLB team over those two decades registered just 82 wins.

#### Cost per Win
The Athletics’ cost per win (total team salary expenditures/team wins) came out to $686,427. At first glance one would say wins are expensive. Consider though that average cost per win leaguewide during this period was $1,122,739. In short, the Athletics spent 31 percent less to win about 4.5 more games per season as compared to the rest of the league.
When considering the disadvantages the Athletics franchise faces, objectively, it’s not unreasonable to conclude that the Moneyball approach has been a success over its two decades of implementation.
